# Final Greenfoot Project
This is the README.md file.

My project is called the Animal Race. 

The goal of this game is to avoid hitting the animals, while collecting apples
and lasting as long as possible in the game. The longer you last and the more apples 
you collect, the higher your score becomes, making it harder for others to beat you.

To play, you just need to hit the space bar, and to move you use the left and right arrow keys.
In the game itself, to boost you can either tap space or hold it down to move faster, and to slow down the boost
you can hit V, this will make it easier for you to move while on boost.

Important places for code:

- The Arrays can be located in the Main Villain and Villain subclasses, they are created to make the bears
move up and down constantly at a tiny angle everytime.

- A title screen is created as under the World, and the end screen is simply just a game over message with the
amount of apples you collected, along with the time.


- With only 4 lines used on the title screen, the user should know what to do as soon as the game starts.

- The sound effects can be found in the man class. The whole point of the sound effects are so that whenever the user touches
either object, a noise should output from the apple or the bears.

- The score is created using a label, which is created in the World Class, along with small parts of adding it up being created in the
objects classes itself.

Any other questions can be answered using the comments in the code.
